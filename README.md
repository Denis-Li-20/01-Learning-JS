This is a work in progress, you will notice that Study Plan | HTML and Study Plan | CSS pages do not have any content.

Make sure to check Contacts and Study Plan | Jave Script pages!

I have used few templates for more "advanced" features like drop-down nav bar and split screen, but those were edited and are not 100% copy-paste replica. Besides I know how those features work now.

Any feedback is highly appreciated!





## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Denis-Li-20/01-Learning-JS/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Denis-Li-20/01-Learning-JS/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
